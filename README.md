# Solana Blockchain Analytics Dashboard

This project is a full-stack application designed to provide real-time analytics from the Solana blockchain. The project consists of two main components: a frontend client built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and a backend server built with Node.js and Docker. The application fetches and displays key blockchain metrics, including market cap distribution of SPL tokens, Solana transactions per second (TPS), and wallet balances.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a challenge to build an analytics dashboard that interacts with the Solana blockchain. The primary goals of the project are to:

- Fetch and display blockchain data: The backend interacts with the Solana blockchain through the public RPC endpoint and provides real-time data to the frontend.
- Visualize data using charts: The frontend application displays the data using various chart types, including pie charts, time series charts, and bar charts.
- Deploy the application in a containerized environment: The backend server is deployed using Docker, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment across different environments.

## Project Structure

- client/: Contains the frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It fetches data from the backend and displays it using charts.
- server/: Contains the backend server built with Node.js. It interacts with the Solana blockchain and provides data to the frontend via a RESTful API.

## Getting Started

Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chingiz19/vybenetwork.git
cd vybenetwork
```

Each subdirectory contains a README.md file with specific instructions for setting up and running the respective parts of the application:

- [Client](./client/README.md) README
- [Server](./server/README.md) README

Instructions for running the client and server can be found in their respective README.md files. Typically, youâ€™ll run the backend server first, followed by the frontend client.

To concurrently run both the frontend and backend applications for development purposes, use the following command: `npm run dev`.

## Deployment

### 1. Start locally

```bash
npm run start
```

### 2. Start with Docker

```bash
npm run docker
```
